[I](https://github.com/itranquility) am currently pursuing my Master's degree at [East China Normal University](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8D%8E%E4%B8%9C%E5%B8%88%E8%8C%83%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6) (2022‚Äì2025) under the supervision of Professor [Ting Su](https://dblp.org/pid/42/6896-1.html). I received my Bachelor's degree from [Yantai University](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%83%9F%E5%8F%B0%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6) (2017-2021). 

My primary research interests lie in static analysis. I am currently working on static analysis for the [HarmonyOS NEXT](https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/harmonyos-next) [App](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/guidebook/harmonyecoapp-guidebook-0000001761818040) within the [ark compiler runtime core](OpenHarmony/arkcompiler_runtime_core) at the **Huawei**‚Äôs 2012 Lab (Trusted Theory, Technology, and Engineering Laboratory), starting in October 2024.
